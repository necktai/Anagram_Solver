# Anagram_Solver
Created a Hashtable with chaining using template class linked list. Reads in dictionary text file and uses tester.cpp or teser2.cpp as the client for testing. Its main utility is to return back the anagram set for scrambled words with the benefit of O(1) access time from hashtables.
